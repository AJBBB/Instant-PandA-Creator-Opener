# Instant PandA Creator - Opens Instantly

<strong>Written in Python 2.7</strong>

You can leave this running all day and whenever you need to turn a preview link to a preview and accept link just paste it into the progam and it will automatically open it in a new tab and it will return to the Enter URL: prompt and wait for another preview link.

If you put in a link it can't handle it will give an error.
