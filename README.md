# Instant-PandA-Creator-Opener

Written in Python 2.7

Creates PandA links from preview links and opens them in a new tab instantly.

You can leave this running all day and whenever you need to turn a preview link to a preview and accept link just paste it into the progam and it will automatically open it in a new tab and it will return to the Enter URL: prompt and wait for another preview link.

If you put in a link it can't handle it will give an error.


Windows Users: Run panda.exe in the Windows Version folder.
